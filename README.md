# Hangman

## A simple hangman game made in Ruby for The Odin Project (TOP)

Hangman is a word simple word guessing game where you put forward individual letters and the opponent fills in the letter you guessed if you were right or adds a part to the 'hangman' drawing if you were wrong. Once the drawing is complete or you have correctly guessed all letters in the word the game is over.

This program:
* Is written in Ruby
* Creates a working hangman game that does the above
* Allows the players to save the game data to an automatically created file and use that file to load a previous game
